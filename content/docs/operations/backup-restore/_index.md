title: Back up and restore
weight: 2
---

MKE 4 supports backup and restore of cluster data through the use of the
[Velero](https://velero.io/) add-on. Backup is enabled by default.

## Configuration

The `backup` section of the MKE4 configuration file renders as follows:

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true
  storage_provider:
    type: InCluster
    in_cluster_options:
      enable_ui: true
      distributed: false
```

By default, MKE 4 supports backups that use the in-cluster storage
provider, as indicated in the `type` option setting of `InCluster`. MKE 4
in-cluster backups are implemented using the [MinIO
add-on](https://min.io/).

The `enable_ui` option setting of `true` indicates that the MinIO Console is
exposed through the Ingress and can be accessed through the UI. Core
backup functionality will work, however, even if
the UI is disabled.

The `distributed` option configures MinIO storage to run in distributed mode.

Refer to the following table for detail on all of the conifguration file
`backup` fields:

| storage_provider.external_options.bucket                   | Name of the pre-created bucket to use for backup storage.                          | ""                  |     ""    |
| storage_provider.external_options.region                   | Region in which the bucket exists.                                                 | ""                  |     ""    |

| storage_provider.external_options.credentials_file_profile | Profile in the Credentials file to use.                                            | ""                  |     ""    |

## Create backups and perform restores

For information on how to create backups and perform restores for both storage
provider types, refer to:

- In-cluster storage provider: [in_cluster.md](in-cluster)
- External storage provider: [external.md](external)

## Existing limitations

- Scheduled backups, an MKE 3 feature that is planned for integration to MKE 4,
  have not yet been implemented.

- Backups must currently be restored in the same cluster in which the backup
  was taken, and thus restoring a backup to a new set of nodes is not yet
  supported for the in-cluster storage provider.

- Backups must be downloaded and uploaded from the in-cluster storage provider using the MinIO Console, as the CLI does not currently support these actions.
