The method for removing nodes from an MKE cluster depends on whether the node is
a control plane node or a worker node.

## Remove a control plane node ##

For informaation on how to remove a control plane node from an MKE 4 cluster, refer to the k0s documentation, [Remove or replace a controller](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/remove_controller/).

## Remove a worker node ##

The removal of a worker node from an MKE 4 cluster is a simple delete
operation.

1. Run the following  `kubectl` command:

   ```bash
   kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.mke/mke.kubeconf delete node <worker_node_name>
   ```

2. Run the following command sequence on the node itself:

   ```bash
   k0s stop
   k0s reset
   reboot
   ```
