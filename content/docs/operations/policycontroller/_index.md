MKE supports easy installation of third-party policy controllers for Kubernetes. 
Currently, the only policy controller supported is [OPA Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/).

## Configuration

You can configure the Policy Controller through the `policyController`
section of the MKE 4 configuration file.
